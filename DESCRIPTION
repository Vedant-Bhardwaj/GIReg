Description: Implements Gini Index Regression (GIR), a semiparametric framework 
    for modeling within-group inequality using quantile-based estimation of 
    conditional distribution functions. The package provides tools for quantile 
    regression and censored quantile regression based CDF estimation, computation 
    of GIR coefficients, goodness-of-fit measures, and bootstrap inference.
